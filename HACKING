Running a development gem2deb version without installing
========================================================

To debug a gem2deb source tree, you might want to run the contained programs
against other packages, but you probably don't want to install a development
version on your system just to be able to that. 

$ . /path/to/gem2deb/tools/shell.bash

This will make the programs in bin/ available in your $PATH, the Ruby code in
lib/ available for Ruby and the debhelper Perl code in debhelper/ available
for debhelper.
