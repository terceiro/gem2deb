=head1 NAME

gem2deb-test-runner - runs test suite contained in Debian Ruby packages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gem2deb-test-runner> [B<OPTIONS>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gem2deb-test-runner> runs the tests shipped inside a source Debian Ruby
package. The way the tests are run is configured in one of the three files:
I<debian/ruby-test-files.yaml>, I<debian/ruby-tests.rake>,
I<debian/ruby-tests.rb>. See the B<FILES> section in B<dh_ruby>(1) for details.

If called without argument in the root of the source package after the package
is built and installed under debian/I<package_name>, then the tests will be run
using the files of the package installed under debian/I<package_name>. This call
is part of the B<dh_ruby>(1) sequence when building a Ruby package with gem2deb.

If the option B<--autopkgtest> is used, the package needs to be installed on
the system. B<gem2deb-test-runner> will not try to load files under debian/ and
will move away temporarily the lib/ and ext/ directory to ensure the test
suite is run against the installed package. This is used in the context of
automatic as-installed package testing, through the autopkgtest framework.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--autopkgtest>

Run the tests against the installed package for automatic as-installed package
testing. Useful in conjunction with B<adt-run>(1).

=item B<-c>, B<--check-dependencies>

Before running the tests, checks whether all dependencies of the package, as
declared in the Rubygems metadata, are present. Makes the program exit with a
non-zero status code (i.e. fails) if they aren't.

If you want to check dependencies during the build, you can add something like
this to debian/rules:

=item B<-d>, B<--check-dependencies-only>

Exit after checking dependencies, i.e. only check dependencies, and don't run
any tests. Implies B<--check-dependencies>.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over

=item GEM2DEB_TEST_RUNNER

Used to pass options to gem2deb-test-runner via the environment. For example,
to make gem2deb-test-runner check dependencies during package build, you can
add the following to I<debian/rules>:

=over

export GEM2DEB_TEST_RUNNER = --check-dependencies
