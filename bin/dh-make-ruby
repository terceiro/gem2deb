=head1 NAME

dh-make-ruby - build Debian source package from Ruby library

=head1 USAGE

B<dh-make-ruby> [I<OPTIONS>] [I<TARBALL>|I<DIRECTORY>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh-make-ruby> will create a basic Debian source package from a tarball named
I<TARBALL> generated with B<gem2tgz>, or from a I<DIRECTORY> containing Ruby
code and metadata in a .gemspec file. If no argument is specified, B<dh-make-ruby>
will build a Debian source package from the current directory.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-p PACKAGE>, B<--package PACKAGE>

Uses PACKAGE as package name. By default, new packages will be named as
ruby-$gem, where $gem is the upstream name. If the package is mainly used as a
library, then it should use the default. On the other hand, if the packages is
mainly used as an application, then you should drop the ruby- prefix by using
this option an explicit package u.

=item B<-w>, B<--overwrite>

Overwrites packaging files that already exists but would be created by
dh-make-ruby if they didn't. Exception: I<debian/copyright> is never touched.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Displays the help

=item B<-v>, B<--version>

Displays version information and exits.

=item B<--no-wnpp-check>

Prevents B<dh-make-ruby> to check wnpp reports to get the number of a possible
ITP (intend to package) bug report. By default, B<dh-make-ruby> does check these
reports, which requires an Internet access.

=item B<--no-dependencies>

Skips the dependency detection based on Rubygems and APT metadata. You should
usually not do this, unless you know what you are doing.

=item B<-o>, B<--offline>

Prevents B<dh-make-ruby> from accessing the internet at all.
