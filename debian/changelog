  * dh-make-ruby: look for test files recursively in generated
    debian/ruby-tests.rake for both test/unit and rspec style tests.
  * dh-make-ruby: gem dependencies will now be included in debian/control
    uncommented and transformed to Debian package names, i.e. foo → ruby-foo,

    will now auto-detect Ruby packages and assume an implicit tests
    definition. debian/tests/control.ex will be created instead, with comments
    explaining to either modify it and rename to control, or delete it.
  * dh-make-ruby: when test/ or spec/ exists, create debian/ruby-tests.rake
    with the appropriate rake invocation to run the tests, instead of being
    insecure and creating files all commented out.
  * install 'gem2deb/rake/testtask.rb' to gem2deb-test-runner instead of
    gem2deb
  * dh-make-ruby: generate uncommented Vcs-* headers in debian/control
  * dh-make-ruby: remove version qualifier from build-dependency on gem2deb to
    remove friction when backporting.

    ruby-all-dev in the shared library dependencies. For that, bump dependency
    on ruby-all-dev to (>= 1:2.1.0.3~)
  * test/test_helper.rb: add test/bin to $PATH during tests
  * test/bin/wnpp-check: mock the actual wnpp-check during tests to avoid

    changelog (Closes: #704651)

    extensions. This fixes building extensions for Ruby 2.1

 -- Antonio Terceiro <terceiro@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Mar 2014 12:42:14 -0300

gem2deb (0.7.2) unstable; urgency=medium

gem2deb (0.7.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * Drop -w (verbose mode) switch from shebang lines
    - that -w does not help us much
    - build logs will become a lot cleaner now
  * dh_ruby: remove blank lines from --help output
  * dh_ruby: install a single gemspec for pure-Ruby packages
    - This single gemspec will be installed at
      /usr/share/rubygems-integration/all and will be made available to all
      interpreters by rubygems-integration >= 1.5. This way when a new
      interpreter is added there is no need to re-upload every package to
      make it seen by that new interpreter rubygems.
  * add ruby-test-unit to Build-Depends
  * dh_ruby: change shebangs from `/usr/bin/env ruby` to `/usr/bin/ruby`
    - multiple interpreters won't be supported for Jessie, and any interpreter
      that is not /usr/bin/ruby will have been installed by hand so we don't
      want system binaries using external interpreters.
  * Add support for running the gem2deb testsuite with autopkgtest
  * Removed hardcoded interpreter versions; use ruby-all-dev instead

    expression metacharacters such as '+' (Closes: #730854)
  * debian/control: add versioned build-depends on ruby-mocha (Closes: #730690)
  * Ignore non-installed interpreters.
    This will ease backports of gem2deb without also having to backport the
    interpreters supported in unstable. (Closes: #730694)

gem2deb (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't interpolate arguments for shell commands.
    This fixes handling of files with weird characters in their names such

    commands in the system that is building a package with gem2deb.
