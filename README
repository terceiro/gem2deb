gem2deb is a set of tools to create Debian packages from Rubygems

The workflow looks like:
    Download gem:
    gem fetch foo
        |
        v
    Create a tarball. It contains the gem spec as metadata.yml
    gem2tgz foo-1.2.gem
        |
        v
    Convert to a Debian source package with sane defaults:
    dh-make-ruby foo-1.2.tar.gz
        |
        v
    Modify, if needed
        |
        v
    Build the package:
    dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

Alternatively, you can use the gem2deb command, that tries to do
everything automatically.

The generated Debian source package uses Debhelper with a specific build system
called "ruby". That buildsystem uses the dh_ruby tool for the various steps
(clean, build, test, install).

Building from source and testing this package:
==============================================
# install build-dependencies, look at the Build-Depends line
# in debian/control

# build the package
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc
# install
sudo debi
# or simply: "rake install"
